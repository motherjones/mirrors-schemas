Undaunted by heavy, heavy guitars and thrashing drums, loquacious Sadie Dupuis
issues a steady stream of dense, intriguing lyrics with poised resolve on this
exciting four-track sequel to Speedy Ortiz's stunning 2013 long-player _Major
Arcana_.

Adept at playing the unreliable narrator, she offers tantalizing glimpses of
lives in flux, murmuring, "I don't know whose call it was that I should share a
life/With someone who resembles me and copies my speech," in the track
"Everything's Bigger" and singing sweetly, "They say I am a spoiled mess/I
never fold up what should fold/And shine much better in my house alone" on
"Shine Theory."

While smart-but-rowdy bands like the Pixies and Breeders remain obvious
touchstones for the Northampton, Massachusetts, quartet, Speedy Ortiz has
forged its own distinctive identity, melding brains, brawn, and a dash of
eccentric magic in impressive fashion.
